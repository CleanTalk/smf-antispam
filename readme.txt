[b]MOD Anti Spam by CleanTalk[/b]
Version: 2.37

Anti-Spam by CleanTalk mod with protection against spambots and manual spam.
No Captcha, no questions, no counting animals, no puzzles, no math.

[b]Extension info[/b]
We have developed our anti-spam extension for SMF that gives maximum protection from spam. You can provide for your visitors a simple and convenient form of posts/registrations without annoying CAPTCHAs and puzzles. Our invisible protection blocks up to 100% of spambots.

[b]Features[/b]
[list]
   [li]Deny signups of spambots[/li]
   [li]If necessary require administrator approval for new members[/li]
   [li]Anti-spam test for the first post on the board for newly registered users[/li]
   [li]Block registrations by language, countries[/li]
   [li]Anti-Spam Log[/li]
   [li]SpamFireWall[/li]
   [li]Personal SpamFireWall Lists[/li]
   [li]Real-time email address validation (Is an email address real or not?)[/li]
[/list]

[b]Low false/positive rate[/b]
This MOD uses multiple anti-spam tests to filter spambots with as lower false/positive rate as possible. Multiple anti-spam tests avoid false/positive blocks for real website visitors even if one of the tests failed.

[b]Spam attacks log[/b]
The CleanTalk Cloud (this plugin is a client application for the CleanTalk Anti-Spam Service) records all filtered comments, registrations and other spam attacks in the "Log of spam attacks" and stores the data in the log for 7 (up to 45) days. Using the log, you can ensure reliable protection of your website from spam and no false/positive filtering.

[b]Real-Time Email Address Existence Validation[/b]
It is very important to be sure that your visitor used their real email address. Spambots use fake email addresses very often, meaning their addresses do not exist. Non-existing email addresses also entail several other problems for website owners:
[list]
[li]You can never contact them by email,[/li]
[li]The client will never receive any notifications from you (account activation letter, password recovery, email distribution, notifications, etc.),[/li]
[li]If you use email marketing for your clients, then a large number of nonexistent emails in the mailing list may result in your IP address being added to various blacklists of email servers.[/li]
[/list]

CleanTalk will check email addresses for existence in real time.

[b]Blocking  disposable & temporary emails[/b]
Block fake and suspicious users with disposable & temporary emails to improve email delivery. So, it also prevents malicious activity, spam bots, and internet trolls.

[b]Private blacklists[/b]
Automatically block comments and registrations from your private black IP/email address list. This option helps to strengthen the protection from a manual spam or block unwanted comments from users. You can add not only the certain IP addresses but also a separate subnet to your personal blacklist.

[b]Blocking users by country[/b]
Automatically block comments and registrations from the countries you have set a ban for. This option is useful in cases of manual spam protection and for protection enhancement. If your site is not intended for an international audience and you do not expect comments/users from other countries.

[b]Blocking comments by "stop words"[/b]
You can block comments which contain "stop words" to enhance spam filtering and messages with obscene words blocking. You can add particular words or phrases.

[b]Check existing users for spam[/b]
With the help of anti-spam by CleanTalk you can inspect through existing accounts to find and quickly delete spam users at once.

[b]SpamFireWall[/b]
CleanTalk has an advanced option "SpamFireWall". This option allows blocking the most active spambots before they get access to your website. It prevents spambots from loading website pages so your web server doesn't have to perform all scripts on these pages. Also, it prevents scanning of pages of the website by spambots. Therefore SpamFireWall significantly reduces the load on your web server. SpamFireWall also makes CleanTalk the two-step protection from spambots. SpamFireWall is the first step and it blocks the most active spambots. CleanTalk Anti-Spam is the second step and checks all other requests on the website at the moment of submitting comments/registers etc.

[b]How SpamFireWall works?[/b]
[list]
[li]The visitor enters to your website.[/li]
[li]HTTP request data are being checked in the nearly 5.8 million of the identified spambot IPs.[/li]
[li]If it is an active spambot, the bot gets a blank page, if it is a visitor then he receives a normal page. This process is completely transparent for the visitors.[/li]
[/list]

All the CleanTalk SpamFireWall activity is being logged in the process of filtering.

[b]Private blacklist for SpamFireWall[/b]
It allows you to add individual IP addresses and subnets to SpamFireWall. It blocks the attacks from IP addresses which are not included in the SFW base yet. This option can help to block HTTP/HTTPS DDoS, SQL, brute force attacks and any others that made it through the HTTP/HTTPS. You can add not only the certain IP addresses but also a separate subnet to your personal blacklist.
